# Weather app

This is the repository for a weather app made with Vue.js and Node.js. 
The application is made for desktop and not for mobile. 
The UI was inspired by the following design https://dribbble.com/shots/3359252-Weather-Daily-UI-037

The app is made to search the weather and the forecast for the coming hours and of a single city. 
The data used is from the openweathermap API. 
It currently is only possible to search on a specific city.
The application is not made to make recommendations in case of spelling mistakes or multiple places with the same name. 
Please keep this into consideration. 
The UI has options for the metric and the imperial system.

In the frontend and the backend folder you can find instructions on how to run the application locally.

To see a demo you can visit the application at https://www.jeffreylobato.com or at https://weather-app-jl.web.app/
